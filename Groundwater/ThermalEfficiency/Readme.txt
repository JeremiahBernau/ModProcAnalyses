Steps in thermal efficiency calculation 

1. Input data has been corrected for potentiometric surface and barometric efficiency

For seasonal thermal efficiency
2. Need to crop data to period where temperature is the dominant control upon water level (fall is the best period in general for this)
	must have little/no rain (increases level)
	water level below the surface (by at least 3-5 cm)
	several month period preferable
3. Thermal efficiency is defined by scalar that is deltaWaterLevel/deltaTemp (units: cm/C)
