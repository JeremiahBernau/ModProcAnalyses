1. (AirPresSub) Subtract air pressure and adjust so that it shows water level relative to surface
2. (VerticalOffsetCor) Shift data vertically, adjusting for installation depth and groundwater density
3. (JoinStandardizeData) Standardize the dataset so they all have the same columns. 
4. (EquivalentHeadCalculation) Correct to equivalent head by adjusting to halite saturated density
5. (BarometricEfficiency) Do barometric efficiency calculation and adjustment
6. (ThermalEfficiency) Determine thermal efficiency - plot in addition to other water level change to understand what water level might be if temperature was constant
